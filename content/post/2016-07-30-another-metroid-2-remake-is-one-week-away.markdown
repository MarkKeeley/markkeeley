title: Another Metroid 2 Remake is one week away
---

Seven days. Seven days from the release of [Another Metroid 2 Remake](http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/). I have been watching and waiting for this project for more than 7 years. With fan made projects like this you always hope it will beat the odds and actually be completed, but you learn to keep your hopes small. Most never actually get very far. In fact, the reason AM2R has the name it does it because with the rise of "game maker engines" a flurry of Metroid 2 fan projects were started. The primitive GameBoy graphics of Metroid 2 practically cry out for a remake - and Nintendo seems to have no interest in updating it like they did with Metroid 1. Of all the Metroid 2 fan remake projects that were started, only AM2R is still standing.

Of course the other great threat to any fan project that manages to make decent progress is a Cease and Desist letter from the corporate intellectual property holder. Yeah, I went with the crazy legal jargon because there are so many examples of games from the 80's/90's where the company went bankrupt and the intellectual property was bought up and now owned by some holdings corporation.

Having played numerous released demos I'm curious what was done with the final boss, the metroid queen. Given the space constraints, I don't think there's much that can be added to the encounter. Back when I beat Metroid 2 on the GameBoy I had no idea about the morph ball -> get eaten technique, I had to beat the final boss the hard way. From the description it soundsÂ like the morph ball method was included.
