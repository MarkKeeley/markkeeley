I'm not a fan of [Caddy's](https://caddyserver.com/) slogan, "Surf the web like it's 2016." It is far too close to the vapid "[It's](https://memegenerator.net/instance/67309523) [current](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/come-on-it-s-2015-current-year) [year](http://www.theonion.com/article/report-stating-current-year-still-leading-argument-35288)" meme. Incidentally, Caddy's slogan last year was "Surf the web like it's 2015." Take a wild guess what it will be in 2 months from now. There's a reason those in marketing typically avoid using specific years in advertising campaigns - it easily dates the promotion. More to the point, what does "Serving the web like it's #CurrentYear" even mean? Nothing. It means nothing. A slogan is an opportunity to sell someone on a feature or give an idea of how that product might improve someone's life. The #CurrentYear slogan gives emptiness. Maybe, just maybe, for the primary developer (Matt Holt) it holds a specific meaning. For others (particularly those more unfamiliar with web servers - the very type Caddy has put so much effort in helping) it holds no meaning at all. I know I went on a bit of a tangent right off the bat, but that has been bugging me since 2015 when I first became aware of Caddy. And to be fair, the awful #CurrentYear slogan has been decreased in prominence from what it was last year.

Okay, enough about the marketing. This website is now using https instead of http thanks to Caddy.

What does that mean? It means that this site serves encrypted webpages. Admittedly, there isn't a pressing reason for the increased security. There's no credit card info to protect and no login passwords to secure from possible "man in the middle" attacks.
