This is Abby. Abby **HATES** loud sudden noises. When thunderstorms roll in she can be found cowering in the basement or lying down under my chair when I'm at the computer. You can probably guess that the fourth of July is Abby's least favorite day of the year. Or days. At a time when west coast states are banning fireworks due to drought, Kansas has expanded the number of days fireworks can legally be used. This greatly displeases Abby. So now Abby refuses to step outside and must be wondering why no one else seems to care that the world is exploding. I wonder if they make ear plugs for dogs.
