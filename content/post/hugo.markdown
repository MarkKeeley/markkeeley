The last time I spent serious time working with web pages/HTML Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6 roamed the earth. Thanks to the lack of Cascading Style Sheet support, if you wanted to do layouts the only options were tables and frames. I became very good at nesting tables within tables within tables.

Thankfully things have changed since then. Microsoft browsers are no longer giants with 90% (or more) usage stats but sit at much less than 10% usage (even when combining Internet Explorer and Edge stats together.) CSS is THE way to format websites, allowing for a clean separation of content and appearance. JavaScript is still an awful mess of a language. Okay, so some things were bound to remain the same. 

When I looked to get back into the web page world I started using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). Having used it, it comes as no surprise to me that WordPress has been the most used Content Management System for years. By some counts, WordPress powers up to 30% of sites on the web. Enormous amounts of time and effort were put into making the software so user friendly. Anyone who has used a word processor like Wordpad or Microsoft Word will feel right at home.
