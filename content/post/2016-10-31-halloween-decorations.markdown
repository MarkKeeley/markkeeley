Based off of dog walks over the years I have to conclude that Halloween is the most popular holiday to decorate for. This probably has something to do with Halloween being one of the easiest - if not THE easiest - to decorate. At minimum, you just buy a pumpkin. One level above that is a pumpkin that has been drawn on. I've seen a few pumpkins in the neighborhood with intricate markers on them, but the ones with crayon drawings have a certain charm to them.
