After yesterday's post on the [Ninja Turtle fan game](https://www.merso-x.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-rescue "TMNT Rescue Palooza") I had to post this speedrun of [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project](https://infogalactic.com/info/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_III:_The_Manhattan_Project) - the timing was just too good to pass up. I'm not going to lie, there is some small bit of satisfaction in hearing the speedrunners say [Leatherhead](https://infogalactic.com/info/Leatherhead_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)) is the second hardest boss in the game. Struggling against the mutant alligator boss that appears only half way into the game is what I remember most about TMNT III. Those old NES games often didn't have so much a difficulty curve as they did a wildly fluctuating difficulty rollercoaster.
