![Flirc case](/media/img/flirc.jpg)

Santa brought me a [Flirc case](https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case) for my newest Raspberry Pi. This is the first metal case I've used, all my previous Pis have had plastic cases. I had been running my Pi 4 with no case and no heat sinks. For some, this setup would just be asking for throttling issues but as a webserver it never runs into prolonged 100% CPU situations.

Each major Pi version has brought about higher temperatures to match faster performance. When the Pi 4 released there was a lot of talk about this version needing active (fan cooling) when running very CPU demanding programs. The improved firmware released later did help address the temperature issue a bit, but I knew I still needed to think about temperatures more than in the past. I knew I did *not* want to deal with fans. I really appreciate the quiet running quality of my Raspberry Pis.

The stand out feature of the Flirc case is that the case itself becomes a heat sink. There is a provided thermal pad (*be sure to remove the plastic on BOTH sides of the pad*) that you put on the CPU. The case then makes contact with the thermal pad, transfering heat from the CPU and into the metal case. The case itself perfectly fit my Pi 4. All the ports/slots were completely accessible. It is a sturdy case and finally my latest Pi is well protected.

So how well does the case perform for my use case? By making use of the command

>vcgencmd measure_temp

the temperature of the Pi can be found. I didn't have a good CPU demanding task to test heavy CPU utilization senarios, but idle situations was easy to determine. With no case/no heat sinks my Pi 4 idled between 47&deg;C to 48&deg;C. With the Flirc case it idles between 42&deg;C to 44&deg;C. Not the most dramatic of temperature drops, but I'll take it.

**Verdict**: Flirc cases are a quality option for anyone looking to protect their Pi 4 and reduce the temperature without using a fan.
