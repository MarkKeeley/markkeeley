With the summer heat finally here, I thought I'd mention a neat little command line weather report trick. Just type **curl wttr.in** in the command line. Obviously, you will need to have curl installed on your computer for this to work. I do enjoy good [ascii art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art).

[Curl's website](https://curl.haxx.se/) states that it is a command line tool for transferring data with URLs. And yes, [wttr.in](https://wttr.in) is in fact a standard website that you can visit in a web browser. This is probably the first time I've ever come across a website that ended in ".in" and I figured it was one of the newer Top Level Domains that had been added in recent years. I was way off. It is actually the country code for India. Seems sort of obvious in retrospect, but I had never seen one before.
