During the night there was a rustling of leaves and some frantic scratching on glass. I found this possum trapped in the basement escape window. Ordinarily it's covered, but _the one time_ it is left open for house painting, it ends up with an adventurous youngster. I ended up putting two long boards (one seen in picture) into the escape window to make a ramp for it to climb out.

The best flashlight in the house + phone camera flash really lit up the area. The picture doesn't even look like it was taken in the middle of the night.
