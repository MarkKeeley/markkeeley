Recently I've been reinvestigating [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://infogalactic.com/info/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). Svgs are a type of image that can increase or decrease in size without losing quality. Svgs are never the right answer for photographs, but for a wide variety of images like icons, charts, or simple pictures they are the perfect solution for a world with so many screen sizes.

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a Linux/Mac/Windows program that specializes in making svg images.
