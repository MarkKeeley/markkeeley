Recently I've been reinvestigating [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://infogalactic.com/info/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). Svgs are a type of image that can increase or decrease in size without losing quality. Svgs are never the right answer for photographs, but for a wide variety of images like icons, charts, or simple pictures they are the perfect solution for a world with so many screen sizes.

I'm not hard core enough to create svgs manually, so I've been using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). One neat feature of Inkscape is its abilty to easily create barcodes and [QR codes](https://infogalactic.com/info/QR_code). While I don't see any benefit of making barcodes (limited to just numbers) I have seen QR codes used in a variety of ways from advertising, business cards, to even pointing to a specific website location for further product instruction.
