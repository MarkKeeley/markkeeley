Over the years I have occasionally had to search the internet for a solution to a problem that almost no one else seemed to be encountering. Eventually I would stumble upon someone's blog where they encountered the same issue, but they also had the solution to the problem. In that grand tradition of helping others I present this post: "**Capturing video with Dazzle DVC100 Rev. 1.1 using Linux in late 2019**."

My Dad has been video recording family events since 1988. This means he has a huge collection of old [VHS-C](https://infogalactic.com/info/VHS-C) tapes - thankfully well labeled. Aware of the issue with tapes fading/degrading over time, I gathered up every vhs-c tape I could find and digitized them all.
