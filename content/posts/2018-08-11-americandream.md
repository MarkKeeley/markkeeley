I've been a big fan of the music from [Two Steps From Hell](http://www.twostepsfromhell.com/) for over a decade now and it is always a pleasant surprise to find out there's been a new release. Okay, so a new release from Thomas Bergersen (who happens to be half of the Two Steps From Hell duo.) This music compilation is found on the [Two Steps From Hell Youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/TwoStepsFromTheMusic/videos) so I'm considering this new Two Steps From Hell music.
