A recent [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) update included the lastest version of [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) (4.11), Valve's Windows to Linux compatiblity layer based off [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/). Along side the improvements was a [list of newly whitelisted games](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/valve-add-additional-titles-to-the-steam-play-whitelist.14692) that meet the quality standards necessary to be automatically available to download and play on Linux. Most of the games on the list I'd never even heard of, but I do have Ducktales Remastered. I had played it years ago, I remembered not having finished the game, and I figured this would make a nice test for Steam's compatiblity progress.

Ducktales Remastered is a lovingly crafted remake of the 1989 NES classic, [Ducktales](https://infogalactic.com/info/DuckTales_(video_game)). The original had good music (especially the moon song) for its time and solid, responsive controls. However certain aspects that seemed normal for the time feel downright clunky these days. "Pogo jumping," making Scrooge McDuck hop around on his cane like a pogo stick, required you to press down for every hop. And make no mistake, the original is an 80's game so it pulls no punches. I think it can be best summed up as "mostly fair, but unforgiving." 

The remake streamlines mechanics to make a better game. The original "hard pogo" is an available option, however the default no longer requires you to press down every hop. Remastered keeps the original "old school" difficulty but adds additional difficulty levels to increase accessibility. Best of all, people behind the remake knew the original had some timeless music and made sure to stay faithful to the originals while no longer being limited by NES hardware.
