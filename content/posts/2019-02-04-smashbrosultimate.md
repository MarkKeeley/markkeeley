While yesterday may have been the "Big Game Day" for some, this weekend also held [Genesis 6](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Tournament:GENESIS_6) - the first large scale tournament event for Nintendo's fighting game [Smash Bros Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com/). Being the first for the game means that people would be watching closely to see which characters would be making it to the top of the tournament. I certainly didn't see any surprises when it came to character choices. Ultimate may be a better balanced game than Brawl and Sm4sh, but there was no chance a Bowser, Sheik, or Bayo was going to make it into top 8.
