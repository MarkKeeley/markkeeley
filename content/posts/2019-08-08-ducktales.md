So here's a bit of info I just found out. Three days after I posted [my experience trying out Ducktales Remastered on Linux](/2019/ducktales-remastered-on-linux/) through Steam's Proton/Wine compatibility layer, [Capcom announced that the game would soon no longer be available for purchase](http://www.capcom-unity.com/capkel/blog/2019/08/06/pick-up-ducktales-remastered-on-sale-now-before-it-leaves-digital-storefronts-starting-august-8th). As I type this, the [game's Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/237630/DuckTales_Remastered/) is showing 37 hours remaining.

As I said in my other post, due to a game breaking bug at the very end that I and others experienced (and was never fixed!), I cannot recommend this game. That being said, I will point out that the game is currently available for a going away price of 75% off. Maybe you'll have more luck than I did. It was a very enjoyable game until the final part.
