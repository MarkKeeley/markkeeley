It is a wonderful and unfamiliar experience to be able to say, "I have all my Christmas shopping done" before December even starts. No caring about Black Friday and Cyber Monday or dreading going to crowded stores. I say this as someone who remembers well the seasonal joys of being in a Walmart at Christmas Eve. I have my gift giving guru sister to thank for this level of preparedness.

From what I've heard this Black Friday/Cyber Monday business started as stores trying to clear inventory for Christmas shopping. Apparently now that these days are big business better deals are found a month before Black Friday/Cyber Monday. There is a limit to just how far the Christmas shopping season can be extended....right? Maybe next year I'll remember to make good use of price tracker websites like [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/).

One thing that stands out to me is how dated the term "Cyber" sounds. Cyber Monday. Cyber Stalking. Cyber Security. Cyber Space. I can't think of any new "Cyber somethings" that have been created in the last decade. Cyber seems to be a marker for things/concepts that arose to widespread awareness in the late 90's or early 2000's.
