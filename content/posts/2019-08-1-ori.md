* walked away in frustration, nearly didn't go back except for the fact I wanted screen shots
* terrible controls
* getting movement upgrades do make the controls more tolerable
* uncommon projectile using movement upgrade
* even the latest version of proton doesn't work
* steam sale
* tiny playable character
* focus on platforming (in spite of poor controls), don't even target enemies with attacks
* hard to tell what is foreground/background at times (very bad for spikes)
* that damn poisoned tree at the beginning of game
