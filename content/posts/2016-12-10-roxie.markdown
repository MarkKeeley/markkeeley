In light of recent news from the Vet, I realized that I have a picture of Abby but not one of Roxie on this site. So I am making a post to correct this while I still can. Roxie is a German Shepherd with some Chow in her. For eleven years she has been the self appointed protector of the territory and hunter of rabbits.
