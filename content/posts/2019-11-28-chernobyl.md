I have no idea how closely the HBO show [Chernobyl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/) depicts the actual events of the 1986 disaster, but the show manages to depict a bleak yet compelling version of the events. There's an almost supernatural horror element to it. Incredibly powerful and yet invisible radiation pouring out of the exposed nuclear reactor. I think the most horrifying part was when the Soviets try to use robots built for use on the moon to clear the roof of the facility, but the radiation immediately destroys the robot. And in what has to be the most Soviet action ever, orders thousands of people to clear the roof that was too radioactive for a space robot.

There's [also a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUeHPCYtWYQ) with the creator of Chernobyl. I haven't finished them all yet but it is very clear this was a passion project.
